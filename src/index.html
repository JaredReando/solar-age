      <h1>Solar Age</h1>
      <h3>What's your age on other planets?</h3>
      <p>Since before the dawn of this sentence, man has gazed upward into the heavens and wondered, what if I had my birthday on one of those shiny lights?</p>
      <p>Lacking the technology to know what that would mean, we have remained pitifully earthbound</p>
      <p>Enter your birthday to see your age on different planets:</p>
